# Ethan's Printed Circuit Board Designs
Boards is a monolithic repository containing all of my personal PCB projects in Altium Designer. Each project is
listed below with a breif description and link to a post about the project on my blog.

## Peterson Development Platform (PDP)
The PDP is a first attempt at an STM32 development board using ST-Link for debugging and an STM32F7 series MCU. The full blog post on the PDP can be found [here](http://portfolio.petetech.net/peterson-dev-platform/)

## A CAN Transceiver Breakout Board
This board breaks out a CAN Transceiver IC to assist with the usage of the CAN bus controller built into STM32 chips. The full blog post can be found [here](http://portfolio.petetech.net/can-transceiver/).
